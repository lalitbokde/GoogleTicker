                        <br />
                        <span>1.1 </span>Survey Information. The Company collects information from individuals when an individual voluntarily completes a Company survey or order form or a registration page either online or offline, or by means of online or offline surveys or order forms or registration pages operated by third parties (collectively, a "Survey"). (As used herein, "online" means using the Internet and related technologies, and "offline" means by methods other than online, including in person, in the mail, using telephone and cell phones, and other methods of communication including future technologies.) In the Surveys, the Company or the third party (the "Third Party") may ask an individual to provide various information to the Company, which may include his or her name, email address, street address, zip code, telephone numbers (including cell phone numbers and carriers), birth date, gender, salary range, education and marital status, occupation, employment information, personal and online interests, and such other information as may requested from time to time (together, "Survey Information").

When acquiring Third Party List Information, the Company seeks assurances from the Seller that the Seller has a right to transfer the Third Party List Information to the Company and that the Seller has a right to provide promotional offers to the individuals whose personal information is included on the list.
                            <br />
                        <br />
                        <span>1.3 </span>Other Information.

                        <span>1.4 </span>Cookie and Webbug Information. The Company uses cookie and webbug technology to associate certain Internet-related information about an individual with information about the individual in our database ("Cookie and Webbug Information"). A cookie is a small amount of data stored on the hard drive of the individual's computer which allows Company to identify the individual with his or her corresponding data that resides in Company's database. You may wish to read more about cookies at <a href="http://www.cookiecentral.com">www.cookiecentral.com</a>. Individuals who use certain of Company's web sites need to accept cookies in order to use of all of the features and functionality of the web sites.

The following information can be sent to Company's computer when a webbug is viewed: the Internet protocol (or IP) address of an individual's computer, the URL of the page where the webbug is located, the time at which the webbug was viewed, the type of browser that received the webbug, and a previously set cookie. If information about the individual who receives the webbug is in Company's records, Company may associate the information received from the webbug with other information about the individual by using the cookie.
